## 5. SUMMARY

The agentic AI space is splitting into:
1. **Platforms** (CrewAI, LangChain) — build-your-own tools
2. **Products** (11x, Sierra, Cognition) — pre-built AI for specific verticals
3. **Service agencies** (LeewayHertz, **us**) — custom AI development

**Our biggest gaps:** No case studies, no blog, no industry-specific framing, no pricing signals, no voice AI offering.

**Our biggest opportunity:** Most agencies target enterprise. We can own the SMB/mid-market segment with accessible pricing and personal service.

**Immediate priority:** Reframe services by industry/use case, add consulting as a service, add a blog, and start collecting case studies (even from demo projects).
